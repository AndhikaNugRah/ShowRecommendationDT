Decision Tree Classification for Singer Show Recommendation System

Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and implement a decision tree classification model that recommends whether or not to show a singer based on their age, experience, ranking, and nationality. 
The system will use a dataset from a CSV file and then train the decision tree model using Scikit-Learn library.

Description:
This project is designed to create a recommendation system for showing singers at an event. 
The system uses a dataset of past shows and features such as age, experience, ranking, and nationality to predict whether or not to show a singer. 
The system will then use the decision tree model to make predictions based on user input.

Features:

Data Reading: The project reads in a CSV file containing data about singers and their past shows.
Data Preprocessing: The project preprocesses the data by mapping categorical values to numerical values.
Decision Tree Modeling: The project trains a decision tree classification model using Scikit-Learn library.
Model Evaluation: The project evaluates the performance of the decision tree model by plotting the decision tree and calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Recommendation System: The project implements a recommendation system that takes user input (age, experience, ranking, and nationality) and uses the trained decision tree model to predict whether or not to show the singer.
